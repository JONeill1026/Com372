			<h2>This is a headline, too!</h2>
			<h3>This is a headline, three!</h3>
			<p>What did you say? A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. We do now. (He holds out the flier and Doc takes it and reads it.) This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.</p>
			<p>(Doc and Marty are standing at the very edge of the tracks that end just at the Ravine. They walk back towards their horses.) Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea. I mean, we can't wait around a year and a half for this thing to get finished. Marty...it's perfect! You're just not thinking fourth dimensionally! Right, right. I have a real problem with that. Don't you see? The bridge will exist in 1985. It's safe and still in use. Therefore, as long as we get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour before we hit the edge of the ravine, we'll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed. We'll have track under us, and coast safely across the ravine!</p>
			<p>Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. (The Dance) (Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.)

			<p>(w.t) I'll be there. (Hallway) (1985 Marty exits through the door. 1955 Marty exits, but sees Lorraine before he gets to the door.) Lorraine! Marty, that was very interesting music. (1985 Marty watches this through the door.) I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.
			</p>
			<p>Right, and take care of that baby! (He rides off with Doc toward the train.) (calling after him) I will! (Blacksmith shop) (Clara runs in.) Emmett! Emmett! Emmett! (She stops and studies the model of the railroad. She picks up the wooden futuristic automobile and reads the words printed on it.) Time machine...
			</p>
			<p>(Saloon - Back Room) (Marty is crouched low as he looks out the window. Tannen now has Doc as a hostage.) Listen up, Eastwood! I intend to shoot somebody today and I'd prefer it to be you. But if you're just too damn yella, I guess it'll just have to be you're blacksmith friend. Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself! You got one minute to decide. You hear me runt? One minute!
			</p>
			<p>Marty, you can't go losing your judgment every time someone calls you a name! That's exactly what causes you to get into that accident in the future. (stops in his tracks and turns to look at Doc) What? What about my future? Doc'I can't tell you. It might make things worse. Wait a minute, Doc...what is wrong with my future?! Calmly. Marty...we all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives. You've gotta do what you've gotta do. And I've gotta do what I've gotta do. (leaves)
